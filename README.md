DURATION:1 MONTH
DESCRIPTION
     This project simulates a real-world e-commerce cart system using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically renders a product grid from a JavaScript array and allows users to add items to their cart, view selected items in a sidebar, update the cart count, see the total price, and remove products â€” all handled entirely on the frontend without any backend. This task helps practice essential frontend skills like DOM manipulation, state management, and interactive UI development
